# Swap Function in C++

## Description
This program demonstrates a simple swap function in C++. The function `swap` takes two integer arguments and swaps their values. The program prints the values of the integers before and after the swap operation.

## How It Works
- The `swap` function takes two integers `x` and `y` as parameters.
- Inside the function, the values of `x` and `y` are swapped using a temporary variable `t`.
- The function prints the values of `x` and `y` after swapping.
- In the `main` function, two integers `x` and `y` are initialized with values `1` and `2`, respectively.
- The values of `x` and `y` are printed before and after calling the `swap` function.
